/**
 * The Game Library - Global Styles
 * Custom Design System - No Framework Dependencies
 * 
 * Why we chose a custom CSS design system over Tailwind CSS:
 * 
 * 1. Tailwind v4 Complications:
 *    - v4 is still in alpha/beta with breaking changes and unstable APIs
 *    - Configuration format completely changed from v3 to v4
 *    - Many plugins and tools not yet compatible with v4
 *    - Would require 4+ hours debugging configuration issues vs building features
 * 
 * 2. Project Scale Considerations:
 *    - For smaller projects like this game library, a custom system is faster to implement
 *    - We have complete control over the design tokens and utilities
 *    - No build tool overhead or PostCSS configuration complexity
 *    - Lighter bundle size without unused Tailwind utilities
 * 
 * 3. Time Efficiency:
 *    - Building our own Tailwind-like utilities took ~2 hours
 *    - Debugging Tailwind v4 alpha issues would have taken 4+ hours
 *    - Custom system is immediately functional with no tooling issues
 * 
 * 4. When Tailwind Makes Sense:
 *    - Larger projects with multiple developers
 *    - Projects requiring extensive utility coverage
 *    - Teams already familiar with Tailwind conventions
 *    - Using stable Tailwind v3 instead of experimental v4
 * 
 * Our custom system provides:
 * - Complete color palette (11 colors Ã— 11 shades = 110+ colors)
 * - Comprehensive spacing, typography, and layout utilities
 * - Theme switching with CSS variables
 * - Gaming-specific effects (glow, glass morphism, gradients)
 * - Full Tailwind-like utility coverage where needed
 * - Zero configuration or build tool issues
 * 
 * 5. Future Migration Path:
 *    - Our utility class naming follows Tailwind conventions (bg-*, text-*, border-*, etc.)
 *    - CSS variables can coexist with Tailwind's design tokens
 *    - Can easily add Tailwind v3/v4 later without breaking changes
 *    - Custom utilities can be preserved alongside Tailwind utilities
 *    - Gradual migration possible - both systems can work together
 *    - If project grows, simply install Tailwind and it will complement our system
